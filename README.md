### Chip 8 Emulator written in JS

- Project to further test my skillz

#### Design - The project is separated into the following parts:

- main.js (loads ROM into memory and runs main emulator loop)
- emulator.js (contains the Emulator class and Opcodes)
- utils.js (contains parseOpcode function - takes in raw opcode and returns each element of the opcode in hex format)
- emulator.test.js (contains tests for each opcode)
